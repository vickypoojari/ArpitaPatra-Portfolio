# Portfolio Content Guide

## Content Philosophy

This portfolio content follows hiring manager best practices:
- **Specific over vague**: "Led 4 releases" beats "Led multiple releases"
- **Outcomes over activities**: "Increased activation by 145%" beats "Improved user onboarding"
- **Context over buzzwords**: "Coordinating 3-5 engineers" beats "cross-functional collaboration"
- **Human over corporate**: "I ship software" beats "I am passionate about building"

---

## 1. Hero Section

### Headline
```
Alex Morgan
```
*Your actual name - keep it simple*

### Tagline
```
I ship software that teams adopt and customers pay for
```

**Why this works:**
- No buzzwords ("passionate", "results-driven", "innovative")
- Focuses on outcomes that matter to hiring managers (adoption, revenue)
- Direct and confident without arrogance
- 10 words, easily skimmable

**Alternatives you could use:**
- "I build products that solve real customer problems and hit revenue targets"
- "I manage roadmaps that turn engineering capacity into shipped features"
- "I coordinate teams to deliver software that users actually use"

---

## 2. About Section ("What I do")

### Current Copy (115 words)
```
I manage product roadmaps from discovery through launch, working with 
engineering, design, and business teams to deliver features that move 
revenue and retention metrics. I've led releases for enterprise SaaS 
platforms, mobile apps, and internal tools—managing backlogs, running 
sprints, and making scope calls when timelines compress. I focus on 
shipping incremental value while keeping stakeholders aligned on what's 
next and why it matters.
```

**Why this works:**
- Opens with core responsibility (roadmap management)
- Mentions specific team types (eng, design, business)
- Names real metrics (revenue, retention)
- Lists concrete activities (backlogs, sprints, scope calls)
- Ends with stakeholder management (key PM skill)
- No fluff, every sentence adds information

**Structure breakdown:**
1. What you do (roadmap management)
2. Who you work with (cross-functional teams)
3. What you've shipped (types of products)
4. How you work (backlogs, sprints, scope decisions)
5. What you prioritize (shipping value, alignment)

## 3. Experience Highlights Section

### Current Copy (6 bullets)
```
✓ Led 4 major product releases from planning through launch, 
  coordinating 3-5 engineers and 1-2 designers per project

✓ Managed stakeholder communication for C-suite executives, 
  translating technical constraints into business language

✓ Reduced sprint planning time by 40% by implementing structured 
  backlog refinement and story estimation workflows

✓ Shipped features that increased user activation by 145% and 
  enterprise contract renewals by 21 percentage points

✓ Ran weekly sprint reviews and retrospectives with distributed 
  teams across 3 time zones

✓ Conducted 50+ user interviews to validate feature requests and 
  identify high-impact improvements
```

**Why this works:**
- Each bullet has a number (4 releases, 3-5 engineers, 40%, 145%, 50+ interviews)
- Mix of leadership (led releases), process (sprint planning), and outcomes (145% activation)
- Shows stakeholder management explicitly
- Mentions distributed teams (relevant for remote work)
- Balance between "what I did" and "what happened as a result"

**Formula for each bullet:**
[Action verb] + [Specific number/scope] + [Optional: outcome/metric]

Examples:
- Led [X] releases with [Y] team size
- Reduced [process] by [%] through [specific change]
- Shipped [feature] that increased [metric] by [%]

## 4. Skills Section (Grouped, No Buzzwords)

### Product Areas
```
• Roadmap planning and prioritization
• Cross-functional team leadership
• Stakeholder management and alignment
• Product launches and go-to-market
• Feature scoping and trade-off decisions
```

**Why this works:**
- Every item is a concrete activity, not a virtue ("innovative", "strategic")
- Matches job description language recruiters search for
- No generic terms like "product vision" or "thought leadership"

### Methodologies
```
• Agile/Scrum sprint planning
• User interviews and feedback synthesis
• Backlog grooming and story writing
• A/B testing and experiment design
• OKR setting and metric tracking
```

**Why this works:**
- Specific processes, not philosophies
- Shows tactical PM work (story writing, backlog grooming)
- Includes both qualitative (interviews) and quantitative (A/B testing)

### Tools
```
• Project Management: Jira, Asana, Linear, Notion
• Analytics: Mixpanel, Amplitude, Google Analytics, SQL
• Design Collaboration: Figma, Miro, FigJam
• Communication: Slack, Confluence, Loom
• Research: UserTesting, Dovetail, Typeform
```

**Why this works:**
- Grouped by category for quick scanning
- Lists industry-standard tools (Jira, Figma, SQL)
- Shows technical capability (SQL) without overstating
- Communication tools matter for remote/distributed teams

## Content Writing Principles

### DO:
✅ Use numbers wherever possible
✅ Name specific tools and frameworks
✅ Mention team sizes and timelines
✅ State outcomes in metrics (%, $, user count)
✅ Use active voice ("I led", "I shipped")
✅ Be specific about scope ("3-5 engineers", "6 months")

### DON'T:
❌ Use buzzwords ("passionate", "synergy", "rockstar")
❌ Make claims without numbers ("significantly improved")
❌ Say "results-driven" or "detail-oriented"
❌ Use jargon that doesn't add clarity
❌ Write paragraphs longer than 4-5 lines
❌ Use phrases like "responsible for" (implies you didn't do it)

## How to Customize This Content

### Replace placeholder numbers with yours:
- "Led 4 releases" → "Led [X] releases"
- "3-5 engineers" → "[your team size]"
- "145% activation" → "[your metric]"
- "40% reduction" → "[your improvement]"

### Adjust for your experience level:
**Junior PM (1-3 years):**
- Focus on execution: "Wrote 100+ user stories", "Ran 50+ sprint ceremonies"
- Mention learning: "Conducted competitive analysis", "Built first product roadmap"

**Mid-level PM (3-6 years):**
- Focus on outcomes: "Increased [metric] by [%]"
- Show independence: "Led end-to-end launch", "Managed stakeholder alignment"

**Senior PM (6+ years):**
- Focus on impact: "$2M ARR", "500K users"
- Show leadership: "Mentored 2 junior PMs", "Defined product strategy"

### Adapt for your industry:
- **B2B SaaS**: Emphasize enterprise features, renewal rates, ARR
- **Consumer/Mobile**: Focus on user growth, retention, engagement
- **Internal Tools**: Highlight efficiency gains, adoption rates, time savings

## Testing Your Content

### The "2-Minute Test"
Can someone scan your portfolio in 2 minutes and answer:
1. What kind of PM are you? (B2B, consumer, technical?)
2. What have you shipped? (Names of product types)
3. What's your impact? (Key metrics)
4. Can you manage stakeholders? (Mentioned explicitly)
5. What tools do you use? (Listed clearly)

If yes to all 5, your content works.

### The "No Buzzwords Test"
Search your content for these words and remove them:
- "passionate"
- "innovative"
- "results-driven"
- "detail-oriented"
- "team player"
- "go-getter"
- "thought leader"
- "strategic thinker"

Replace with specific activities or metrics.

### The "Numbers Test"
Count how many numbers appear in your:
- About section: Should have 0-1 (keep it qualitative)
- Experience section: Should have 6+ (one per bullet minimum)
- Case studies: Should have 12+ (multiple per impact statement)

---

## Example: Bad vs Good Content

### ❌ Bad Hero Tagline
"Passionate product leader driving innovation and creating delightful user experiences through data-driven decision making and strategic thinking"

**Problems:**
- 16 words (too long)
- Buzzwords: passionate, innovation, delightful, data-driven, strategic
- No outcomes mentioned
- Sounds like every other PM

### ✅ Good Hero Tagline
"I ship software that teams adopt and customers pay for"

**Why it works:**
- 10 words (scannable)
- Zero buzzwords
- Focuses on outcomes (adoption, revenue)
- Distinct and memorable

---

### ❌ Bad Experience Bullet
"Responsible for coordinating cross-functional teams to deliver high-quality products that meet customer needs"

**Problems:**
- "Responsible for" (weak passive voice)
- No numbers
- "High-quality" (subjective)
- "Meet customer needs" (vague)

### ✅ Good Experience Bullet
"Led 4 product releases with 3-5 engineers per project, delivering features that increased enterprise renewal rates from 68% to 89%"

**Why it works:**
- Specific numbers (4 releases, 3-5 engineers)
- Clear outcome (renewal rate improvement)
- Active voice ("Led")
- Quantified impact (68% → 89%)
